Simple project on Codecademy to test my knowledge and understanding of file structure.
I thought I understood it, but I cannot seem to make the index.css nav img show even though using the same file structure call in my html works just fine.
I would very much like to understand what has gone wrong and how to fix it, more to understand what I don't understand than to fix it of course.
Why is background-image:  url("./resources/images/pattern.jpeg"); incorrect?

Please do not get very technical, I am very new at this. If possible show me what you are talking about.
